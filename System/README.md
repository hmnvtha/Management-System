EventSourcing-Java is a lightweight microservices project built using Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL to demonstrate simple event-sourcing concepts. It consists of two services: the order-service, which accepts and confirms orders by persisting order events such as CREATED and CONFIRMED, and the shipping-service, which records shipping events like SHIPPED and DELIVERED through HTTP endpoints. Both services store events directly in a MySQL database without any message brokers, making the architecture easy to run and understand. This project is designed for learners who want to explore event persistence, microservice communication patterns, and relational event stores using Spring Boot.
